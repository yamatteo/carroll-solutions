> Consider Maxwellâ€™s equations, $\mathrm d F = 0$, $\mathrm d * F = *J$, in 2-dimensional spacetime. Explain why one of the two sets of equations can be discarded. Show that the electromagnetic field can be expressed in terms of a scalar field. Write out the field equations for this scalar field in component form.

Not sure what it means.
