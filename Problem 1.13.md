>Consider adding to the Lagrangian for electromagnetism an additional term of the form $\mathcal L' = \tilde{\epsilon}_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F^{\mu \nu} F^{\rho\sigma}$. Express $\mathcal L'$ in terms of $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf B$. Show that including $\mathcal L'$ does not affect Maxwell's equations. Can you think of a deep reason for this?
