> There are a lot of motivational words attached here to what is a very simple problem; don’t get too distracted. In ordinary electromagnetism with point particles, the part of the action which represents the coupling of the gauge-potential one-form $A^{(1)}$ to a charged particle can be written $S = \int_\gamma A^{(1)}$, where $\gamma$ is the particle worldline. (The superscript on $A^{(1)}$ is just to remind you that it is a one-form.) For this problem you will consider a theory related to ordinary electromagnetism, but this time in 11 space-time dimensions, with a three-form gauge potential $A^{(3)}$ and four-form field strength $F^{(4)} = \mathrm d A^{(3)}$). Note that the field strength is invariant under a gauge transformation $A^{(3)} \to A^{(3)} + \mathrm d \lambda^{(2)}$ for any two-form $\lambda^{(2)}$.
> **(a)** What would be the number of spatial dimensions of an object to which this gauge field would naturally couple (for example, ordinary E+M couples to zero-dimensional objects—point particles)?
> **(b)** The electric charge of an ordinary electron is given by the integral of the dual of the two-form gauge field strength over a two-sphere surrounding the particle. How would you define the “charge” of the object to which $A^{(3)}$ couples? Argue that it is conserved if $\mathrm d F^{(4)} = 0$.
> **(c)** Imagine there is a “dual gauge potential” $\tilde A$ that satisfies $\mathrm d(\tilde A) = * F^{(4)}$. To what dimensionality object does it naturally couple?
> **(d)** The action for the gauge field itself (as opposed to its coupling to other things) will be an integral over the entire 11-dimensional spacetime. What are the terms that would be allowed in such an action that are invariant under “local” gauge transformations, for instance, gauge transformations specified by a two-form $\lambda^{(2)}$ that vanishes at infinity? Restrict yourself to terms of first, second, or third order in $A ^{(3)}$ and its first derivatives (no second derivatives, no higher-order terms). You may use the exterior derivative, wedge product, and Hodge dual, but not any explicit appearance of the metric.

> More background: “Supersymmetry” is a hypothetical symmetry relating bosons (particles with integral spin) and fermions (particles with spin 1/2, 3/2, etc.). An interesting feature is that supersymmetric theories are only well-defined in 11 dimensions or less—in larger numbers of dimensions, supersymmetry would require the existence of particles with spins greater than 2, which cannot be consistently quantized. Eleven-dimensional supersymmetry is a unique theory, which naturally includes a three-form gauge potential (not to mention gravity). Recent work has shown that it also includes the various higher-dimensional objects alluded to in this problem (although we've cut some corners here). This theory turns out to be a well-defined limit of something called M-theory, which has as other limits various 10-dimensional superstring theories.

I don't even try.
