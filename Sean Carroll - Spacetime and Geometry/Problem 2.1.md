Any point in $S^1$ is identifiable with a value $\theta \in [0, 2\pi[$, that is an angle parametrization $\theta \mapsto (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$. Therefore any point in $\mathbb R \times S^1$ is identifiable with a tuple $(z, \theta)$. We construct a chart with $(z, \theta) \mapsto (e^z \cos(\theta), e^z \sin(\theta))$. The image of this function is an open subset of $\mathbb R^2$ because the only point missing is the origin.
