# Sean Carroll - Spacetime and geometry

I'm working my way through this book and since there is no solutions' book available I'll post my solutions. Maybe someone will find them helpful, maybe someone will suggest improvements.

I use vscode [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-vscode#master), so you probably will not be able to render properly directly in github and need to download to see pictures and math as I see them.

7. Prolate spheroidal coordinates can be used to simplify the Kepler problem in celestial
mechanics, They are related to the usual cartesian coordinates (x, ¥, z) of Buclidean
three-space by
x = sinh siné cosg,
y =sinh x sind sing,
z =cosh x cosf.

Restrict your attention to the plane y = 0 and answer the following questions.
(a) What is the coordinate transformation matrix 3x*/3x" relating (x, z) to (x, )?
(b) What does the line element ds? look like in prolate spheroidal coordinates?

8. Verify (2.78): for the exterior derivative of a product of a p-form w and a g-form 1,
we have
d(@
A m) = @) A+ ()P A @dn).

9. In Euclidean three-space, suppose #F = g sinf do A do.
(a) Bvaluate d x F = #J.
(b) What is the two-form F equal to?
(c) What are the electric and magnetic fields equal to for this solution?
(d) Evaluate fi, dxF, where V is aball of radius R in Euclidean three space.

10. Consider Maxwell’s equations, dF = 0, d%F = %/, in 2-dimensional spacetime.
Explain why one of the two sets of equations can be discarded. Show that the electro‘magnetic field can be expressed in terms of a scalar field. Write out the field equations
for this scalar field in component form.
11. There are a lot of motivational words attached here to what is a very simple problem;
don’t get too distracted. In ordinary electromagnetism with point particles, the part

of the action which represents the coupling of the gauge-potential one-form A to a
charged particle can be written S =, AM, where y is the particle worldline. (The
superscript on A is just to remind you that it is a one-form.) For this problem you
will consider a theory related to ordinary electromagnetism, but this time in 11 space-

time dimensions, with a three-form gauge potential A® and four-form field strength

F® = dA®). Note that the field strength is invariant under a gauge transformation

A® 5 A® 1 40 for any two-form A,

(a) What would be the number of spatial dimensions of an object to which this
gauge field would naturally couple (for example, ordinary E+M couples to zerodimensional objects—point particles)?
(b) The electric charge of an ordinary electron is given by the integral of the dual of
the two-form gauge field strength over a two-sphere surrounding the particle. How
would you define the “charge” of the object to which A®) couples? Argue that it

is conserved if d

F(¥) = 0.

(c) Tmagine there is a “dual gauge potential” A that satisfies d(A) = *F @, To what
dimensionality object does it naturally couple?

(d) The action for the gauge field itself (as opposed to its coupling to other things)
will be an integral over the entire 11-dimensional spacetime. What are the terms
that would be allowed in such an action that are invariant under “local” gauge
transformations, for instance, gauge transformations specified by a two-form A
that vanishes at infinity? Restrict yourself to terms of first, second, or third order

in A®

and its first derivatives (no second derivatives, no higher-order terms).

You may use the exterior derivative, wedge product, and Hodge dual, but not any
explicit appearance of the metric.

More background: “Supersymmetry” is a hypothetical symmetry relating bosons
(particles with integral spin) and fermions (particles with spin 3, 3, etc.). An interesting feature is that supersymmetric theories are only well-defined in 11 dimensions
or less—in larger numbers of dimensions, supersymmetry would require the existence
of particles with spins greater than 2, which cannot be consistently quantized. Eleven-

dimensional supersymmetry is a unique theory, which naturally includes a three-form
gauge potential (not to mention gravity). Recent work has shown that it also includes

the various higher-dimensional objects alluded to in this problem (although we've cut
some corners here). This theory turns out to be a well-defined limit of something called

M-theory, which has as other limits various 10-dimensional superstring theories.
