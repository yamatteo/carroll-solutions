# Solved problems

I'm working my way through these books and I've decided to post my solutions to the problems. Maybe someone will find them helpful, maybe someone will suggest improvements and explain to me where I'm wrong.

I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-vscode#master), so you probably will not be able to render properly directly in GitHub; you'll need to download the source to edit and see pictures and math as I see them. Otherwise, you should probably be able to look at a rendered version at [https://yamatteo.github.io/carroll-solutions](https://yamatteo.github.io/carroll-solutions/README)
