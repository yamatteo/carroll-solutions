> Imagine that space (not spacetime) is actually a finite box, or in more sophisticated terms, a three-torus, of size L. By this we mean that there is a coordinate system $x^\mu = (t, x, y, z)$ such that every point with coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$ is _identified_ with every point with coordinate $(t, x + L, y, z)$, $(t, x, y+L, z)$ and $(t, x, y, z+L)$. Note that the time coordinate is the same. Now consider two observers; observer A is at rest in this coordinate system (constant spatial coordinates), while observer B moves in the x direction with constant velocity $v$. A and B begin at the same event, and while A remains still, B moves once around the universe and comes back to intersect the worldline of A without ever having to accelerate (since the universe is periodic). What are the relative proper times experienced in this interval by A and B? Is this consistent with your understanding of Lorentz invariance?

From $A$'s perspective, the path of $B$ has length $L$ and coordinate duration $L / v$ (which corresponds to the proper duration of $A$'s path); therefore, because of time dilation, it has proper duration $L / (\gamma v)$. From $B$ perspective, it stayed still for a coordinate duration of $L / (\gamma v)$ while $A$ moved with velocity $-v$ for the same duration, meeting $B$ again at the end. So, by $B$ account, because of time dilation, $A$'s trip has a proper duration of $L / (\gamma^2 v)$. If we suppose that proper duration is a scalar, $L/v = L / (\gamma^2 v)$, which is a contradiction.
