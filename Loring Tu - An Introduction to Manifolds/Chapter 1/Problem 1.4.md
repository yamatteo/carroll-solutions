In [[Loring Tu - An Introduction to Manifolds/Chapter 1/Problem 1.3|Problem 1.3]] we proved that $\tan$ and $\arctan$ are $C^\infty$ functions, one the inverse of the other.
By definition, $f$ is $C^\infty$ because each of its components $f_i(x_i) = \tan(x_i)$ is. And its inverse $h: \mathbb R^n \to \left]-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right[^n$ defined by $h(y_1, \dots, y_n) = (\arctan(y_1), \dots, \arctan(y_n))$ is also $C^\infty$.
