> Find all points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in a neighborhood of which the functions $x$, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1$, $z$ can serve as a local coordinate system.

The jacobian of such functions is $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 2x & 2y & 2z \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right]$$ and the determinant is equal to $2y$, so it is OK as long as $y \neq 0$.
