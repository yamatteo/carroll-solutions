> Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, and $GL(V)$ the group of all linear automorphisms of $V$. Relative to an ordered basis $e = (e_1, \dotsc, e_n)$ for $V$, a linear automorphism $L \in GL(V)$ is represented by a matrix  $[{a^i}_j]$ defined by $$L(e_j) = \sum_i {a^i}_j e_i$$
> The map $$\begin{eqnarray}\phi_e: GL(V) &\to& GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \\ L &\mapsto& [a^i_j]\end{eqnarray}$$ is a bijection with an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ that makes $GL(V)$ into a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ manifold, which we denote temporarily by $GL(V)_e$. If $GL(V)_u$ is the manifold structure induced from another ordered basis $u = (u_1, \dots, u_n)$ for $V$, show that $GL(V)_e$ is the same as $GL(V)_u$.

Basically, we have to show that $\phi_e$ and $\phi_u$ are compatible. Let's take, $\phi_u \circ {\phi_e}^{-1}$: it is a function from $\mathbb R^{n\times n}$ to $\mathbb R^{n\times n}$. Both $\phi_u$ and ${\phi_e}^{-1}$ are linear, so their composition is linear, therefore smooth.
