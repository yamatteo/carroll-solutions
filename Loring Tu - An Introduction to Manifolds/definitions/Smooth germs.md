The set $C_p^\infty$ consists of _germs_ of $C^\infty$ functions at a point $p$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically:

Consider the set $S$ of all pairs $(f,U)$, where $U$ is a neighborhood of $p$ and $f: U \to \mathbb{R}$ is a $C^\infty$ function. Define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $S$ by: $(f,U) \sim (g,V)$ if there exists an open set $W \subseteq U \cap V$ containing $p$ such that $f|_W = g|_W$.

The equivalence class of $(f,U)$ under this relation is called the germ of $f$ at $p$, denoted by $[f]_p$. The set of all such germs is called $C_p^\infty$:
$$C_p^\infty = \{[f]_p : f \text{ is $C^\infty$ defined near } p\}$$
