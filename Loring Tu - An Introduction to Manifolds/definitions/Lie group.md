A Lie group is a $C^\infty$ manifold $G$ having a group structure such that the multiplication map
$$\mu: G \times G \to G$$
and the inverse map
$$\iota: G \to G, \iota(x) = x^{-1},$$
are both $C^\infty$.

Similarly, a topological group is a topological space having a group structure such that the multiplication and inverse maps are both continuous. Note that a topological group is required to be a topological space, but not a topological manifold.
