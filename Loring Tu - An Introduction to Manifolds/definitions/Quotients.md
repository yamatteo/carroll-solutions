**Quotient topology.** Let $S$ be a topological space and $\sim$ an equivalence relation on $S$. Let $\pi : S \to S/{\sim}$ be the projection map that sends $x \in S$ to its equivalence class $[x]$. The quotient topology on $S/{\sim}$ is the topology generated by declaring a set $U \subseteq S/{\sim}$ to be open if and only if $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $S$.

Let $f: S/{\sim} \to Y$ be some map to another topological space. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if $f \circ \pi$ is continuous.

If the quotient space $S/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff, then the equivalence class
$[p]$ of any point $p$ in $S$ is closed in $S$.

The the quotient space $S/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff if and only if the graph of $\sim$ is closed in $S \times S$.

If $\sim$ is an open equivalence relation on a second-countable space
$S$, then the quotient space $S /{\sim}$ is second countable.
