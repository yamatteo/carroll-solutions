Let $A$ be an algebra over a field $K$. A $K$-linear map $D: A \rightarrow A$ is called a _derivation_ of $A$ if it satisfies the Leibniz rule:
$$D(ab) = (Da)b + a(Db)$$
for all $a,b \in A$.

The set of all derivations of $A$, denoted $\text{Der}(A)$, forms a vector space over $K$.

As a special case, when $A = C_p^\infty$ is the algebra of germs of $C^\infty$ functions at a point $p$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, a _derivation at $p$_ (or _point-derivation_) is a derivation $D: C_p^\infty \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

In other words, a derivation at $p$ is a linear map $D: C_p^\infty \to \mathbb{R}$ that acts like a directional derivative in that it obeys the Liebniz rule when applied to [[Smooth germs|germs]] of $C^\infty$ functions at $p$.

The set of all point-derivations at $p$ is the vector space $\mathcal{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ over $\mathbb{R}$.
